# React Example

This example demonstrates how to use the `oauth-fech` package to make requests to both public and OAuth-protected resources in a React application.

## Live Demo

👉 Check our live demo: [`oauth-fetch` Playground](https://oauth-fech.oauthlabs.com)

## Install Dependencies

Install the dependencies using npm:

```bash
npm install
```

## Configuration

This example already uses a demo application with `Auth0`, if you want to change with your own, consider changing `Auth0Provider` props in `App.tsx`.

```bash
npm run dev
```
